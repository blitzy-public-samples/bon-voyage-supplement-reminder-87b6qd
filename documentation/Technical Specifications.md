# 8. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## 8.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The supplement reminder website primarily focuses on a single-use interaction where users input their phone numbers and preferred reminder times. However, to ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access to the system, the following authentication and authorization measures will be implemented:

### 8.1.1 User Authentication

1. Phone Number Verification:
   - Upon initial submission of the phone number, a one-time verification code will be sent via SMS.
   - Users must enter this code to confirm their phone number before the reminder is set.

2. Reminder Modification:
   - To modify or cancel a reminder, users will need to authenticate using a unique link sent to their registered phone number.

### 8.1.2 Admin Authentication

For administrative access to the system:

1. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Username and password
   - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) using an authenticator app

2. Session Management:
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for maintaining authenticated sessions
   - Token expiration set to 1 hour for enhanced security

### A.2 SMS Character Limit

The reminder message "Bon voyage! Take the supplement so you feel better tomorrow!" is 65 characters long. This fits within the standard 160 character limit for a single SMS message, ensuring cost-effective delivery and compatibility with all mobile devices.

### A.3 Time Zone Handling

To ensure accurate reminder delivery across different time zones, the system should use a robust time zone library such as `moment-timezone`. This will help in:

1. Storing user's local time zone
2. Converting user's preferred reminder time to UTC for storage
3. Calculating the correct local time for sending reminders

### A.4 Database Indexing

To optimize query performance, the following indexes should be created in the PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_phone_number ON users(phone_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_reminder_scheduled_time ON reminders(scheduled_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_analytics_event_time ON analytics(event_time);
```
