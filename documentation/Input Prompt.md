We are developing a website to remind consumers to take a supplement by sending a text message at a specified time. Users access the website via a QR code on the product packaging, input their phone number and the desired reminder time, and receive a text message reminder.

Product Overview:
* **Website Purpose**: The website aims to remind consumers to take a supplement by sending a text message at a specified time. Users access the website via a QR code on the product packaging, input their phone number and the desired reminder time, and receive a text message reminder.
* **Target Audience**: People aged 21-35, with a focus on women.
* **Launch Timeline**: Official launch is planned for 5 months from now.

Core Features:
1. **User Input Form**:
   * **Fields**:
      * Phone number input (required).
      * Time selection for reminder (default set to 12:00 am, with ability to adjust).
   * **Validation**: Phone number must be validated for correct format. Display error messages for incorrect entries.
2. **Reminder Functionality**:
   * **Default Reminder Time**: Automatically set to 12:00 am; users can adjust as needed.
   * **Text Message Content**: "Bon voyage! Take the supplement so you feel better tomorrow!"
   * **Automated Scheduling**: Ensure that the reminder is sent at the chosen time.
3. **QR Code Integration**:
   * Website URL should be optimized for easy access via QR code scanning, directing users to the reminder setup page.
4. **Backend Functionality**:
   * **Data Storage**: Store phone numbers, selected reminder times, and timestamps of when users input their data.
   * **Basic Analytics**: Ability to track the general location (e.g., city) based on the user's input data (if possible without violating privacy norms).
5. **Security**:
   * **User Data Protection**: Implement measures to ensure the safety of user phone numbers and data, including encryption.
   * **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR or other relevant local laws.

Design & UI/UX:
* **Color Scheme**: Orange, navy blue, and baby blue.
* **User Flow**:
   * Users scan the QR code → directed to a simple form page.
   * Input phone number and adjust reminder time if desired → press submit.
   * A confirmation message displays that their reminder has been set.

Integration Requirements:
* **Third-Party SMS Service**: Integrate with a service to send text messages to users at the specified time (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid).
* **Analytics Tool**: Consider integrating a basic analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics) to track website traffic and user behavior (optional).

Performance Requirements:
* **Quick Loading Time**: The website should load quickly and be optimized for both desktop and mobile, considering it will be accessed primarily through mobile devices.
* **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly, as most users will access it via their phones.

Content Management:
* **Website Content**:
   * Focus on a simple landing page with clear instructions for entering phone numbers and selecting reminder times.
   * Basic FAQ section covering privacy policy, data security, and general use of the reminder system.
